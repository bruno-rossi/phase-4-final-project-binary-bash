## 3. Skills learned

Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Building python classes with class properties and one-to-many relationships between classes:
The game uses 3 classes, Player, Game, and Level. Player-Game and Level-Game are one-to-many relationships. Player-Level are many-to-many relationships.

- Working with primary data types in Python: strings, integers, floats, lists, dictionaries.
- Instance methods, and class methods, lambda functions.
- Loops and conditionals, list comprehensions.

Databases (SQLite3) and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
- Writing and executing SQL against a database
- Create/Drop tables, insert/update/delete table rows.
- Associated tables using foreign keys.

Using external libraries with my code:
- Diff checker library: difflib library
- Color printer: termcolor library
- Timer: time library
